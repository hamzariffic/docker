# docker
Use Docker and python scripts to deploy and control MQTT brokers and clients on your local machine. Connect them using a network and exchange messages. Automate tasks such as creating networks, deploying services, and starting containers. Clean up after yourself and bring down services, remove the overlay network, and tear down the Docker Swarm.
