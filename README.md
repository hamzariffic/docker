# docker
Use Docker and python scripts to deploy and control MQTT brokers and clients on your local machine. Connect them using a network and exchange messages. Automate tasks such as creating networks, deploying services, and starting containers. Clean up after yourself and bring down services, remove the overlay network, and tear down the Docker Swarm.   

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package and deploy applications in isolated containers. You can use Docker to deploy MQTT brokers and clients on your local machine and connect them using a network.

To initialize a single-node Docker Swarm and create a network, you can use the docker swarm init and docker network create commands, respectively. You can then use the docker service create command to deploy services with multiple replicas of a Docker image.

To publish and subscribe to an MQTT broker, you can use the docker run command to start a container running the efrecon/mqtt-client image and specify the sub or pub command. You can also use the pyshorteners library to generate shortened URLs that you can use in your python scripts or share with others.

Once you have set up your MQTT broker and clients, you can use python scripts to control their behavior and send and receive messages. You can use the docker library to interact with the Docker API and perform tasks such as creating networks, deploying services, and starting containers.

To clean up after yourself and bring down services, remove the overlay network, and tear down the Docker Swarm, you can use the docker service rm, docker network rm, and docker swarm leave commands, respectively.

In summary, Docker and the docker library provide a convenient way to deploy and control MQTT brokers and clients on your local machine and exchange messages between them. You can use python scripts to automate these tasks and build more complex applications on top of the MQTT protocol.
